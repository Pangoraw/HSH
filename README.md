# Home Sweet Home

**Introduction :**

*HSH is a tool that will help centralize all of your house's dependencies.*

**Installation :**

*To install HSH, you must simply download this repository and the Pangoraw-Plugins one in a folder called `plugins`.*

**Configuration :**

*To setup your HSH server, you can create a configuration file at the root of the HSH folder, call it `config.json` and then HSH will use the configuration you have written instead of the default configuration.*

*A `config.json` file with the default configuration would look like this :*

`{ "server" : { "port" : 8080, "host" : "127.0.0.1" } }`
